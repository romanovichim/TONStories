# Interview with Oleg Andreev

## Tell us about yourself and what you're working on.

I am a software designer and a cryptographer. For the past 9 years I design blockchain systems and protocols. For the last year I am building Tonkeeper wallet and other infrastructure for TON.

## What motivated you to start working on your product?

I've been long interested in making blockhains scale and be user-friendly, and finally TON offers a cool solution. TON is a unique platform that offers a secure yet scalable solution to smart contracts.

## What's your tech stack?

Tonkeeper is a mobile wallet for iOS and Android. To interact with the TON network we build TonApi service in Go. We also provide JS SDK for app developers to connect apps with Tonkeeper.

## How have you attracted users and grown your product?

We position ourselves as a go-to wallet in the TON ecosystem and a super-app. We participate in key partnerships that promote TON in general, and highlight Tonkeeper as the easiest to use wallet for newcomers. 

## What's your business model?

We are growing our userbase implement profit-sharing with our partners and the users of our commercial services such as subscriptions system.

## What are your goals for the future?

We want to help grow TON ecosystem and make Tonkeeper the central super-app that everyone uses.

## What are the biggest challenges you've faced and obstacles you've overcome?

The biggest challenge is the novelty of the TON technology and rapid growth of the ecosystem:  tooling and education are lagging behind the explosion of the apps and services.

## If you had to start over, what would you do differently?

Thatâ€™s a tricky question. We learn how to design things better from real world experience and iterations. Without past decisions we would not know how to better design wallet plugins, subscriptions, staking pools and TON connect protocol. 

## What's your advice for developers on TON who are just starting out?

If you are building smart contracts on TON, the key is to understand its asynchronous multi-contract architecture that differs wildly not only from Ethereum model, but even from the traditional client-server applications. Scalable apps almost always consist of many contracts and various kinds of tokens issued to users, making the state of the application largely distributed. There are some useful articles on [https://society.ton.org](https://society.ton.org/) and [ton.org/docs](http://ton.org/docs) to start with.

## Where can we go to learn more about your product?
