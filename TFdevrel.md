## Introduction

Hello! Can you tell me please who will answer to my questions? 

## About grants and footsteps:

When you first get acquainted with the description of grants and footsteps, the footsteps are seemed to be for small articles/contracts/projects. But, There are some examples of the [$70,000 footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/84) or [footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/142) the foundation for a future application lead to some questions.Where is the line between footsteps and grants? I would like to understand what frames or restrictions there are for Footstep.

## About Processes:

What is supposed to be done with Footsteps that are not executed after assign for a long time? For example, [1](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/19) and [2](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/43) have not been completed for more than six months. Can another person apply for an existing Footstep after some time has elapsed?

Is it possible, having already received one assign to a footstep, to get a second one?
Let's say, I am developing something on TON and realize that somewhere there is clearly not enough description/documentation and I want to make a tutorial article.

What happens if someone wants to dump Footstep, for example, writes that he is ready to make Footstep 20% cheaper?

## About Technologies:

Many footsteps are open now ([1](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/204), [2](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/205), [3](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/224)) via the TON SDK. 
However, they don’t mention at all, let’s call it “TON native technologies”, for example, ADNL. The interaction is supposed to be built through RPC, i.e. through some intermediary, as, for example, in [tonweb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb). Are there any plans to stimulate development specifically taking into account “TON native technologies” (ADNL, RLDP etc.)

## About content:

The discretionary Recognition Grant is referred to the [post](https://t.me/tonsociety/40) TON Society. From the post it is clear that the grant is issued for technical posts for the TON Society Blog, but the details / scope of the grant are not clear, also, in the [grant description](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-program), there are no words about Recognition Grant. Was it a one-time action, or can a similar grant be received now? What is the approximate amount of such a grant?

Are there any plans for audience support for footsteps and grants related to technical content? It looks like high-quality technical content has just settled on small channels and has not reached the audience. For example, now [footstep is open](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/218) for about $ 7800, it is clear that the interesting and high-quality content is planned, but they plan to upload videos to the channel with less 50 subscribers. Perhaps, there is some selection of such completed footsteps in the telegram channel Ton Society, at least a little bit, could help the situation.

On the website [ton.org]( https://ton.org/en/grants) in the area of the interest section on grants, there is academic research. Could you reveal what is supposed to be done inside such grants regarding TON and, if possible, show some examples?

## Conclusion:

Thank you very much for the answers, and also thanks for the transparent system of grants and footsteps, I'm sure it will only get better!
