# Interview with Andrey Tvorozhkov

## Tell us about yourself and what you're working on.

Hi! My name is Andrey, and Iâ€™m working on TON-ecosystem project called Disintar. 

We start with NFT Marketplace and some open-source TON products such as CLI for devs and quick to install local TON network. Soon we will present new cool stuff and products. They will be NFT-related :)

## What motivated you to start working on your product?

I originally wanted to gift the NFT to my friends in December 21 because I didn't have an idea for gifts. I started looking into NFT in Ethereum, they seemed too simple to me. At the same time, Durov wrote a post about how the coolest developers are sitting in TON. The choice was clear :)

In the future, our whole team supported the idea of creating a product on TON. 

The idea of the marketplace was suggested by my good friend and cofounder of our company, Gregory :)

We brought in Rita to work with the audience and maintain the conceptualism of the project. She, too, is a cofounder of the Disintar. 

Currently I am very motivated by our team and the opportunities we have.


## What's your tech stack?

We use toncli (fift + func) for smart contracts.

Python as backend, React as frontend. 
C++ as TON full-node own private upgrades.

Also, all apps are in our own kubernetes cluster with CI&CD pipelines and private docker registry & git.

How have you attracted users and grown your product?

We mainly work with large NFT collections as an IT partner. We help to make complex chips in smart contracts and in general to understand this complex technology stack. 

The main users were involved at the very beginning, because we cooperate with a lot of large NFT projects. 

We haven't invested in marketing until now, but times are changing and we'll be launching a very cool and big offline event this September. This will be our first attempt to attract external users to Disintar.


## What's your business model?

We take a 5% of sales on Marketplace, as well as additional amounts for some features in smart contracts.

In total, we earned six figures in dollars.

In the near future, we want to change our business model by introducing tokenomics. We spent a lot of time talking to funds and working on tokenomics.

## What are your goals for the future?

We are trying to make TON more accessible to more users in every sense of the word. Both for developers, NFT projects, and ordinary users.

Our main goals lie in the launch of a new direction, which is designed to lower the entry threshold for ordinary users.


## What are the biggest challenges you've faced and obstacles you've overcome? 

There were a lot of problems and obstacles. 

Basically, we still don't know how to estimate the timing of feature development. The technology is too heavy and raw. It is on the one hand very cool and good, on the other hand very difficult.

Also at the very beginning of our journey we faced with unwillingness of TF and friendly teams to help in any way (mostly in terms of PR) because we are an external team without friends from the hangout. Now the situation is a bit better.

Absolutely, we get a lot of dev support from Ton Foundation and try to be just as helpful in open-source.


## If you had to start over, what would you do differently?

Nothing

## What's your advice for developers on TON who are just starting out?

Come make products and build the future. There is so much you can do and so much you can achieve.

You can imagine TON as an empty field with a couple of village buildings that will soon become a modern city.

Don't be afraid to do difficult things.


## Where can we go to learn more about your product?

We mainly have a twitter and a Russian-speaking telegram channel. Links below:
